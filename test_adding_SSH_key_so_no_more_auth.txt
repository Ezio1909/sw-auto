It is so fucking tired to binding SSH keys between local machines and github ...

In case of future reference:

SSH keypair setup: https://gist.github.com/xirixiz/b6b0c6f4917ce17a90e00f9b60566278

Generating new SSH key and add to ssh-agent: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

Testing SSH connection: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection

Error permission denied: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh/error-permission-denied-publickey


One important note here

ssh -vT git@github.com

will ONLY check the generated keygen in /home/namyeukhanh/.ssh
when set up connections between local machines and github

Save SSH keygen in another location will be useless. Therefore, always make sure the generated keygen is inside /home/namyeukhanh/.ssh

Now, it is likely that there will be another warning said that UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE
Check it out then: https://gist.github.com/zoxon/4e0e77e3be930d286d62
